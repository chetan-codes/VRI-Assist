# VriAssist

VriAssist is a comprehensive platform for conducting motor and cognitive assessments, generating reports, and managing medical and health records.

## Overview

VriAssist utilizes Angular CLI version 16.2.4, along with HTML5, CSS, and TypeScript, to provide a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with its features.

## Development Server

To start the development server, run `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to access the application. The server automatically reloads upon any source file changes.

## Code Scaffolding

Generate new components using `ng generate component component-name`. Additionally, you can create directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules using the Angular CLI.

## Build

Execute `ng build` to compile and build the project. The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute unit tests via Karma. Ensure robustness and reliability of the codebase with automated testing.

## Running End-to-End Tests

Execute `ng e2e` to run end-to-end tests on a platform of your choice. Note that you may need to add a package implementing end-to-end testing capabilities before using this command.
